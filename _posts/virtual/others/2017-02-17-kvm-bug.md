**[Bug 155841] Kernel panic with high network tarffic to KVM guest**

	https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155841
	https://github.com/ffnord/ffnord-puppet-gateway
	Our KVM host crashes randomly when there is high network traffic to the guest. For the host crashlog see the attached screenshot.
	We are using this guest as a Freifunk (freifunk.net) gateway. We suspect that this occurs when to many nodes are connecting to the gateway.
	
	At startup of the host error messages like the following are shown:
	[   45.769454] kvm: zapping shadow pages for mmio generation wraparound
	[   52.593232] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x606
	[   76.593085] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x611
	[   76.593138] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x639
	[   76.593183] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x641
	[   76.593227] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x619
	[   76.607495] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x611
	[   76.607559] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x639
	[   76.607609] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x641
	[   76.607658] kvm [1807]: vcpu0 unhandled rdmsr: 0x619
	
	This happening under high network load is only our suspicion.

**Can we increase vring size over 1024**

	But I don't think this is a problem.
	Vring is just a container, we can say the max request's length is 1024, but the capacity of container shouldn't be the length of max request. For example, we can put 4K requests with one s/g list into vring at one time if the vring size is 4096, and 4 requests with 1024 s/g list into vring at one time.
	Ignoring the indirect table support. Am I right?
