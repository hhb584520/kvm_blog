## 1.不定代词
every(每一)，no(无)，any(若干)及some（一些）可与 one, thing 构成复合代词，与 where 构成复合副词。不定代词可作主语、宾语和表语。

	every		no		any			some
	everyone	no one	anyone		someone
	everybody	nobody	anybody		somebody
	everything	nothing	anything	something
	everywhere	nowhere	anywhere	somewhere

请看例句：

	A. 作主语：
	    这些代词作主语时都作单数看待，因此使用单数谓语动词。
	    Everyone is asleep.
	    Everythine is untidy.
	    Nobody has told me about it.
	B. 作宾语：
	    I've got nothing to wear.
	    I've heard nothing.
	    I saw no one.
	C.作表语
	    There's nothing on the shelf.
	    There's somebody in the garden.
	    That's nothing.

## 2. 与 some 与 any 的用法一样

	somebody/someone/something/somewhere 一般用于肯定句。
	anybody/anyone/anything/anywhere           用于疑问句与否定句
	nothing/nobody/no one/nowhere 相对于 not anything/ anybody/ anyone/ anywhere:
	Someone is asking to see you.
	There's something under that chair.
	I don't know anyone here.
	Is there anything on this shelf?
	I went nowhere = I didn't go anywhere.
	I saw no one = I didn't see anyone.
