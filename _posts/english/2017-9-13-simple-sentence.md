## 5. 动词不定式
在英语中，当一个动词被另一个动词紧随时，它们之间必须加不定式符号(to)。不定式符号后面的动词只能是原形，而不能是过去式或是分词形式。

(1) 不定式作动词的宾语（动词+to...）:

       He wants to buy a car.
       He hopes to pass the French exam.
       I want to leave.

(2) 有许多动词可以带名词/代词宾语(通常是人称代词宾格)，后面再跟不定式（动词+名词/宾格代词+to...）

       I want you to carry it.
       He wants them to listen to it.
       Tell him to move it.

(3) 不定式的否定形式是在 to 之前加 not：

       He decided not to buy the house.
       He told me not to close the window.
       Tell him not to move it.
       He is telling him not to hurt himself.  She doesn't want him to hurt himself.
