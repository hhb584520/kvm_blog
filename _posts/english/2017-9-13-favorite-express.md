### 12.1 some, any
在英语中，some和any是两个最常用的数量词。用some和any时，一般不必精确地说明数量到底有多少大或者多少小。它的作用非常像是 a/an 的复数。

1) some (表示确定的数量)表示“某些但不是全部”的意思，通常用于肯定句中。在疑问句中，所希望的回答是 Yes 时也可使用 some。如：

	There is some water in the glass.    玻璃杯里有些水
	There are some cigarettes in the box.
	Have you got some paper-clips in that box.
	some 加可数名词或不可数名词时，在流畅的话语中一般不重读 .

2) any(表示不确定的数量)通常用在含有 not 或 -n't 的否定句中，也可用于表示我们不能确定答案是肯定还是否定，或者用于预料得到的回答是 No 的疑问句中。

		I have a lot of / many friends here. 
        在这里我有许多朋友。

    2) a lot of与lots of同义，其后可以接可数名词复数或不可数名词，而many之后只能接可数名词复数。例如：
        There is a lot of / lots of snow this year. 今年雪下得多。
        ★但不可以说：There is many snow this year. 

    3) 两者后接可数名词复数时，a lot of 通常用于肯定句，而many可用于各种句式。例如：
        I have a lot of comic books.
        我有许多漫画书。
        I don’t have many comic books.
        我没有很多的漫画书。
        Do you have many comic books? 
        你有很多漫画书吗？
 
    4) much 和 many
         much 只能修饰不可数名词，many 只能修饰可数名词复数
         How many people are there in your family?
         How much money did you spend on it?

   (3) plenty of, 充足的，足够的
        后面可跟可数名词或不可数名词。
 
   (4) a little 和 a few
        a little 少许（用于不可数名词之前）   little (less 比较级    least 最高级)
